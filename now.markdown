After 13 seasons of skeleton, [I took a much-needed break from competition](http://go.teamusa.org/1MRhE2r).  Now I'm back to training and have set my sights on **winning a medal in Korea**.

At the moment, my time is devoted to:

- Training for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. 
- Working for [Instaviser.com](http://www.instaviser.com). 
- Personal programming projects like [sledsheet.com](http://www.sledsheet.com).
- Chairing the Athlete Advisory Council of the USABS.
- Reading and recommending books. 

I'm often asked to do other things, especially app development and web dev/design. I appreciate the thought, but I have to decline so I can focus on my work. As my priorities change, I'll update this page.

The inspiration for this page came from [Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org/now). It's a reminder for me to focus on a few essential things.
