**Welcome**. I am an Olympic athlete and writer with a focus on strategy, performance, and leadership. I study successful athletes, I share what I learn here on my website, and in my occasional (usually monthly) newsletter. How reading can make us better thinkers and leaders. I study world leaders, elite athletes, successful entrepreneurs, and other world-class performers to discover the keys to their success. Then I distill and share what I learn.

I try to take a broad approach, drawing from history, philosophy, sport, politics, and war.
