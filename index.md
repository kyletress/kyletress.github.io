**Welcome**. I'm Kyle Tress, an Olympic skeleton athlete, writer, and Ruby on Rails developer. When I'm not writing code or sliding headfirst down a mountain of ice at 90 miles per hour, I read good books and share them in [my monthly newsletter](/newsletter).

Here you'll find my thoughts on *strategy*, *performance*, and *leadership*. I write articles and recommend books on these topics, taking inspiration from history, philosophy, politics, sport, and war.

I'm no longer using social media. If you want to say hello please email me at  [kyle@kyletress.com](mailto:kyle@kyletress.com). Here's [what I'm doing now](/now).
