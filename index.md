**Welcome**. I'm Kyle Tress, an Olympic athlete and writer with a focus on strategy, performance, and leadership. My work draws inspiration from history, philosophy, art, politics, sport, and war. I read and recommend books, write essays, and share what I learn here and in [my monthly newsletter](/newsletter).

I no longer use social media. If you want to say hello please email me: [kyle@kyletress.com](mailto:kyle@kyletress.com). Here's [what I'm doing now](/now).
