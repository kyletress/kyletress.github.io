Hi, I'm **Kyle Tress**. I'm an Olympic athlete in the sport of skeleton. When I'm not racing headfirst down a mountain of ice at 90 miles per hour, I'm a senior Ruby on Rails developer at [Instaviser](http://www.instaviser.com) and an advocate for ethical design and mindful use of technology. 

I'm currently studying machine learning and data science. In my free time I read a lot of books and recommend my favorites in [my monthly reading list email](/newsletter). 

**In Brief:**

- 2014 Olympian in skeleton [[faqs](/faqs)]
- United States Olympic Committee Athlete Representative.
- USA Bobsled/Skeleton Athlete Advisory Committee Chairman.
- USA Bobsled/Skeleton Board of Directors.
- Lead Software developer at [Instaviser](http://www.instaviser.com).
