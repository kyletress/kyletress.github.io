I'm **Kyle Tress**. I'm an Olympic athlete in the sport of skeleton. When I'm not racing headfirst down a mountain of ice at 90 miles per hour, I'm a Ruby on Rails developer at [Instaviser](http://www.instaviser.com) and an advocate for the ethical design and mindful use of technology.

I'm currently studying machine learning and data science. I also like to read and I recommend my favorite books in [my monthly reading list email](/newsletter).

I have decided to become [nonline](http://jasonrehmus.com/social/2017/02/23/nonline-means-no-longer-online/) until March 2018 as I train and prepare for the Olympic Games.

**In Brief:**

- 2014 Olympian in skeleton [[faqs](/faqs)]
- United States Olympic Committee Athlete Representative.
- USA Bobsled/Skeleton Athlete Advisory Committee Chairman.
- USA Bobsled/Skeleton Board of Directors.
- Lead Rails developer at [Instaviser](http://www.instaviser.com).
