Hi I’m **Kyle Tress**, an Olympic athlete in the sport of skeleton.  

I competed in the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi. I’m currently training for the 2018 Games in Korea. Outside of sport, I’m the lead software developer at [Instaviser](http://www.instaviser.com), a platform which connects mentors to learners via video and phone. I write code in Ruby, but I’m learning Swift so I can build some personal iOS apps.

I occasionally write essays on topics like performance, reading, and leadership. Speaking of reading, once a month I recommend a few favorite books in [my reading list email](http://www.tinyletter.com/kyletress).

I post on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kyletress) and [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/kyletress), share code on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/kyletress), and publish long form content on [Medium](https://medium.com/@kyletress). If you’d like to follow my skeleton career, you can do so on [my Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/kyletressskeleton) or on [Sledsheet](https://www.sledsheet.com).

The best way to contact me is to [send me an email](mailto:kyle@kyletress.com). I don’t have voicemail and I rarely answer calls.

If you’re curious, here’s [what I’m doing now](/now).
