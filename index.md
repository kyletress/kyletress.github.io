Hi, I'm **Kyle Tress**. Welcome to my personal website.

I write about performance, and how reading can make us better thinkers and leaders. I study world leaders, elite athletes, successful entrepreneurs, and other world-class performers to discover the keys to their success. Then I simplify it and share it here and in my [monthly newsletter](/newsletter).

Select articles:

- [What is Performance Reading?]()
- [How to read 100 books this year]()
- [Deliberate practice and the art of learning]()
- [How to get smarter every day]()
- [Peak Success]()

Much of my website is devoted to reading and sharing book reviews. Check out a few of my recent favorites:

- [Meditations]()
- [The Years of Lyndon Johnson]()
- [Letters from a Stoic]()
- [The Gene: An Intimate History]()
- [Peak: The Science of Expertise]()

Here's [what I'm doing right now]()
