**Welcome**. I'm Kyle Tress, an Olympic athlete and writer with a focus on strategy, performance, and leadership. I read and recommend books, write essays, and share what I learn here and in [my newsletter](/newsletter). I take a broad approach to these studies, drawing inspiration from history, philosophy, sport, politics, art, and war.

I don't use social media. If you need to get in touch (or want to say hello) please email me: [kyle@kyletress.com](mailto:kyle@kyletress.com).
