In lieu of social media, I write a monthly [tinyletter](https://www.tinyletter.com/kyletress) for friends and fans. I despise the current *build an audience/personal branding* groupthink. I just want to share a few updates with a small group. You're welcome to subscribe (or unsubscribe) at any time.

I usually write about:

- Books and reading recommendations
- Training and performance
- Skeleton (and racing in general)
- Occasional tech-stuff (rarely)
- Life events and updates.

<form action="https://tinyletter.com/kyletress" method="post" target="popupwindow" onsubmit="window.open('https://tinyletter.com/kyletress', 'popupwindow', 'scrollbars=yes,width=800,height=600');return true"><p><label for="tlemail">Enter your email address</label></p><p><input type="text" style="width:140px" name="email" id="tlemail" /></p><input type="hidden" value="1" name="embed"/><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" /></form>
