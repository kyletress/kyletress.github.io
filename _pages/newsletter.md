# Newsletter

My weekly email newsletter is my *primary means of communication* on the web. I don't use social media, I'm bad at email, and I disabled voicemail on my phone -- but I *do* reply to every email I get from subscribers.   

I talk about the books I love, share a few favorite links and articles from around the web, and occasionally include a private essay. I'd love to have you as a subscriber, and of course you can unsubscribe at any time.
