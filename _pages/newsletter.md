# Newsletter

Once a month I send a simple email to friends recommending a few excellent books. It goes out to about 50 people -- no frills, no nonsense. I jump around between genres a bit but the general theme of the newsletter is *performance reading*: books that make us better thinkers, leaders, and performers.

I'd be happy to have you as a subscriber, and you can unsubscribe any time you like.
