Hi I’m Kyle. I’m an Olympic athlete in the sport of skeleton. When I’m not racing headfirst down a mountain of ice at 90 miles per hour, I like to read, write, and code.

I tweet from [@kyletress](http://www.twitter.com/kyletress), share photos on [instagram](http://www.instagram.com/kyletress), and make videos on YouTube. You can email me at [kyle@kyletress.com](mailto:kyle@kyletress.com).

I’ve been fascinated with technology ever since I built my first website in 1994. I’ve worked with many different languages, tools, and technologies over the years, but I’m mostly interested in Ruby on Rails and iOS development. Former clients include [Capital Health System New Jersey](http://www.capitalhealth.org), [Design by Diane Alder](http://www.designbydianealder.com), USA Bobsled and Skeleton, and Nature of Speed, LLC.

Aside from skeleton and technology, I'm interested in performance, flow, and flourishing. Flourishing comes from the field of positive psychology and means to live within the optimal range of human existance. I approach it from an interdisciplinary standpoint by reading and conducting research in the fields of philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, computation, and future studies. I share what I learn here on my site and in my monthly [newsletter](/newsletter).
