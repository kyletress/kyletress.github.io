This is my personal website. It's been online in some form since 2003. The web has grown bloated. In some cases, this makes sense. But for pesonal websites? No. How simple can a personal website be while remaining functional? I believe we can strip much of what we deem necessary on the *personal web* and reduce it to its essentials. That's why my site is so plain. I hate clutter. I hate unecessary sidebars, pages, javascripts, and other crap that gets thrown into most websites and apps just in case (YAGNI). I also don't want to be hired based on how my site looks. This site is intentionally plain, because the words are what matter. 

## Essentialism

The web offers amazing interactivty and richness of design. However most of it is innapropriate for personal websites. I am sick of bloat, over-designed websites that weight 2mb and track me all over the web. So I intentionally under-designed this website to be as lightweight and fast as possible. The focus is entirely on the content.
