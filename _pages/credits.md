This is my personal website. It's been online in some form since 2003.

## Essentialism

The web offers amazing interactivty and richness of design. However most of it is innapropriate for personal websites. I am sick of bloat, over-designed websites that weight 2mb and track me all over the web. So I intentionally under-designed this website to be as lightweight and fast as possible. The focus is entirely on the content.
