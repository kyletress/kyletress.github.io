[kyletress.com](http://www.kyletress.com) is built and maintained by me. The design is built on a Jekyll theme of mine called [skeleton](https://www.github.com/kyletress/skeleton.git). It's designed to be simple, and to respect the reader first and foremost. Here are some notes on the tools used:

### Quick Notes

- The site is powered by Jekyll, the static site generator.
- The base theme is Skeleton, which I created and open-sourced.
- System fonts! (San Francisco, Roboto, etc)
- Sass and Coffeescript.
- Liberal use of Flexbox.
- The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages]()
- When I want to quickly add some content, I do so through [Siteleaf](), which I love and *highly* recommend.

### Tools and Apps

- [Atom]() code editor.
- Terminal.app
- 12" Retina MacBook (base model)
- [Ulysses]() for writing content
- iPad Air 2 (more and more of my work is done on iOS)
