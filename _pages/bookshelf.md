# Bookshelf
Below I'm compiling a complete catalogue of the physical books I own. I've wanted such a list for a long time, mostly because it's convenient but also because I like reading other people's lists and discovering new books.

It's a work in progress, partially complete and in no particular order. Some day I'll add my reading notes to each entry.  

- [The Death of Expertise](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190469412/?tag=tress-20): The Campaign Against Established Knowledge and Why it Matters
- [Be Like The Fox](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393609723/?tag=tress-20): Machiavelli In His World
- [The History of the Peloponnesian War](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0140440399/?tag=tress-20)
