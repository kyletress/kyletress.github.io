# Bookshelf
Below I'm compiling a complete catalogue of the physical books I own. I've wanted such a list for a long time, mostly because it's convenient but also because I like reading other people's lists and discovering new books.

It's a work in progress, partially complete and in no particular order. Some day I'll add my reading notes to each entry.
