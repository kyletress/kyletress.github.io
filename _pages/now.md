This page is inspired by [Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org). Currently I am:

- Training for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games.
- Working for [Instaviser]().
- Personal programming projects[^1].
- Chairing the Athlete Advisory Council of the USABS.
- Reading and recommending books.
- Writing this website.

I’m often asked to do other things, especially app or web development. I appreciate the thought, but I have to decline so I can focus on my work. As my priorities change, I’ll update this page.

The inspiration for this page came from Derek Sivers. It’s a reminder for me to focus on a few essential things.
