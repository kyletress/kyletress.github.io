In 2013 I began filming 1 second videos every day (inspired by [this project](https://www.ted.com/talks/cesar_kuriyama_one_second_every_day)). I didn't miss a day in 2013, and I also filmed throughout the 2014 Winter Olympic Games.

My discipline has waned a bit since that first year, but I'm getting back into it. It's an amazing project -- a life changing one, really -- and it's hard to see the benefits until you have enough seconds (or rather, years) compiled to properly look back on.
