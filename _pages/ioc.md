I am running for **the IOC Athlete Commission** and I need your help.

During the Rio Olympics, I published an open letter to my fellow olympians on integrity and clean sport. That letter was viewed over 150,000 times. It struck a chord with athletes who are tired of the same old song and dance from the IOC. I am running for the Athlete Commission to begin the fight to reclaim honor, integrity, and sanctity of sport around the world.

### My Platform
I'm running on a simple platform:

- Hard on doping.
- More technology.
- Improving athlete services
