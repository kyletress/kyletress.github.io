Technology has trained us to lust after novelty, to desire more.

A powerful combination of **consumerism** and **technology** has fundamentally changed the way we think and behave, and how we interact with one another. This is neither good nor bad, but a test of our self-control. All we can truly control in life are our reactions to external events.  

1. Privacy isn't dead. It just needs to be reclaimed.
2. You aren't missing out if you abandon social media.
3. **Read**. Hard books, and many of them.
4. Read books, not blogs.
5. Pack light, go fast.
