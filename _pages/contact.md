## How to contact me

I'm intentionally hard to reach. I don't use social media (rare tweets are auto deleted), instead focusing on my personal website.

1. Requests for skeleton-related interviews should be directed to the offices of [USA Bobsled/Skeleton](https://www.usabs.com).
2. If you're looking for advice on getting started in skeleton, first check my [frequently asked questions](/faqs).
3. I don't use voicemail and I only return calls/texts from friends or family.
4. Much of my email goes unread.
