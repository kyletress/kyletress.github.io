## How to contact me

I'm largely offline these days, which makes me harder to reach than most people. I don't have a general purpose email address and I don't use social media. The best way to reliably reach me is either in person, or through my [newsletter](/newsletter).

If you have a book recommendation, speaking opportunity, or just want to say hello, please send a note to [hello@kyletress.com](mailto:hello@kyletress.com).
