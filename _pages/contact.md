## How to contact me

I'm trying to use technology in a more mindful way; the tradeoff is this makes me harder to reach than most people. I don't have a general purpose email address and I don't use social media. The best way to reliably reach me is in person.

If you have a book recommendation, speaking opportunity, or just want to say hello, please send a note to [hello@kyletress.com](mailto:hello@kyletress.com). *I love hearing from you, but I'm usually unable to respond*.

### Interviews
Skeleton-related interviews should be booked through [Kristen Gowdy](mailto:kristen.gowdy@usabs.com?subject=Interview request for Kyle Tress) at USA Bobsled/Skeleton.

### Skeleton advice and coaching
For skeleton advice, first see my [frequently asked questions](/faqs), and send a message to [skeleton@kyletress.com](mailto:skeleton@kyletress.com) if your question isn't answered there.
