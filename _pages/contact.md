## How to contact me

First, a confession: **I'm intentionally hard to reach**. I don't use social media (rare tweets are auto deleted) and my personal website is my only home on the web, though I do post select essays to [Medium](). That being said, if you *really* want to contact me, please see the simple rules below:

1. Requests for skeleton-related interviews should be directed to the offices of [USA Bobsled/Skeleton](https://www.usabs.com).
2. If you're looking for advice on getting started in skeleton, first check my [frequently asked questions](/faqs).
3. I don't use voicemail and I only return calls/texts from friends or family.
4. Much of my email goes unread and I apologize for that. Please don't take it personally.
5. If none of the above apply: **kyle@kyletress.com**
