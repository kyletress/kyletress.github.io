## How to contact me

Hey! First, a confession: **I'm intentionally hard to reach**. I don't have a general email address and I don't use social media. The best way to reach me is in person. I do occasionally receive interesting opportunities via email, so if you'd like to interview me, or you have an interesting offer, opportunity, or introduction, please use the contact information below. I'll respond to those proposals which are a good fit for my schedule and interests.

**2 simple rules:**  

1. Requests for skeleton-related interviews should be directed to the offices of [USA Bobsled/Skeleton](https://www.usabs.com).
2. If you're asking advice on skeleton, first check my [frequently asked questions](/faqs). 90% of the questions I get are answered there.

Sound good?
