## How to contact me

I'm intentionally harder to reach than most people. I don't have a general purpose email address and I don't use social media. I try to maximize the time I have outside my main commitments: training for the Olympics, working at a startup, writing a book, and my athlete rep duties. The best way to reliably reach me is in person, but here are some other ways you can get in touch.

### Interesting 
I occasionally receive interesting opportunities via email, which I love. Just send a note to [interesting@kyletress.com](mailto:interesting@kyletress.com) and I'll reply to those which are a good fit for my schedule and interests. 

### Interviews 
All skeleton-related interviews should be booked through Kristen Gowdy at USA Bobsled/Skeleton.

### Skeleton advice and coaching
For advice on sliding, please see my frequently asked questions, and send a message to [skeleton@kyletress.com](mailto:skeleton@kyletress.com) if your question isn't answered there. 

At present, it's unlikely I'll coach after retirement. 

### Employment 
I'm open to full-time employment opportunities assuming they are remote (at least through March 2018). I will consider part-time and contract work, but not equity offers. Send a note to [hello@kyletress.com](mailto:hello@kyletress.com).
