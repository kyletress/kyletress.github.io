## How to contact me

I'm intentionally harder to reach than most people. I don't have a general purpose email address and I don't use social media. The best way to reliably reach me is in person.

I occasionally receive interesting opportunities via email, which I love. Just send a note to [interesting@kyletress.com](mailto:interesting@kyletress.com) and I'll reply to those which are a good fit for my schedule and interests.

### Interviews
All skeleton-related interviews should be booked through Kristen Gowdy at USA Bobsled/Skeleton.

### Skeleton advice and coaching
For advice on sliding, please see my frequently asked questions, and send a message to [skeleton@kyletress.com](mailto:skeleton@kyletress.com) if your question isn't answered there.
