## How to contact me

Hey! First, I have a confession: I'm intentionally hard to reach. I don't use social media (rare tweets are automatically deleted), I only answer calls from friends and family, and I'm starting to limit my usage of email (and the internet in general). The very best way to speak with me is in person. If that's not possible, please read the simple rules below before reaching out:

1. Requests for skeleton-related interviews should be directed to the offices of [USA Bobsled/Skeleton](https://www.usabs.com).
2. If you're asking for advice on skeleton, first check my [frequently asked questions](/faqs) before contacting me.
3. You are *not* a recruiter, salesperson, solicitor, PR firm, or self-published author seeking a book review.

Sound good?
