Modern combined bobsled/skeleton/luge facilities are expensive, costing millions, sometimes *hundreds* of millions, to build. The Whistler Sliding Centre had a price tag of $105MM CAD, and rumor has it the Sanki Sliding Centre in Sochi cost substantially more. I'd love to see more natural tracks like the one in St. Moritz, Switzerland, but the knowledge and experience to build them is highly specialized.
