Competing in the Olympic Games is the obvious choice. I'm also proud of being named the 2005 [Randy Price Memorial Award Winner](http://www.rpmfund.org). I'm honored to be a three-time winner of the Athlete's Choice Award. I'm humbled  the athletes have chosen me to be their representative to the United States Olympic Committee. But no one will ever say it better than Olympic Champion Curt Thomasevic:

> My proudest accomplishment in bobsled isn’t two Olympic medals. It is knowing that after 10 years, no one can ever question my commitment, my honor, or my character and intentions. I did my best to make myself and my teammates better every day. I had an experience that no one can ever take away. And I don’t need an Olympic medal to remind me of that.
