I have averaged 175 runs per season over the past 15 years for an estimated total of **2,625 runs**. That's roughly the distance from New York to San Francisco, which at 60mph average speed I would have covered in 44 hours.

Lake Placid makes up the bulk, with Park City in second followed by Igls, Austria in a distant 3rd.
