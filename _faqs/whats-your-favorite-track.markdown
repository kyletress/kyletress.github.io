It's a tie between Lake Placid, NY (my home track) and St. Moritz, Switzerland. I probably have close to 2000 runs on Lake Placid, and it's the track on which I learned to slide.

St. Moritz is the only remaining natural track in the world. There's something magical about sliding 1800 meters through the woods on a hand-carved track. It's my best track in Europe, and is tied for my best ever WC performance (5th).
