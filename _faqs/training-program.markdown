Now that I'm older, I train smarter. Instead of 6+ hours a day on the track and in the gym, I do a brief warmup, some speed work, and an hour-long lifting session 3 days per week. The rest of the time should be spent in recovery, but I'm lazy in that regard.

I also eat differently. I fast 16 hours a day and eat all my meals (2000+ calories) in an 8-hour window. It's fantastic.
