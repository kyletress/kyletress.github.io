The Olympics were an amazing experience. It was my first time competing, so I had nothing to compare them to. I heard from more experienced Olympians that Sochi didn't really have the atmosphere of other Olympics, but I was impressed.

Yes it was warm. No I wasn't worried about security. Transportation was good and the crowds showed up.

Opening Ceremonies was my favorite part of the experience, because it lived up to the hype. Walking into the Fischt Stadium is something I will never forget.
