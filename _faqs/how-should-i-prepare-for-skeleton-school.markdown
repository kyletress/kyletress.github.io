There is no preparation necessary for Skeleton School. You don't need to learn how to drive beforehand -- you *can't*. You can only learn that aspect of the sport through experience, which comes with taking runs down the track. Skeleton School is mostly an opportunity to see if you really enjoy the sport. It looks fun on TV, but there have been many people who thought the same thing only to arrive in Lake Placid, take a run, and leave that same day never to return. Just show up, listen to the coaches, and see if you like it.
