Four things make a great skeleton athlete:

1. A fast start
2. Good equipment
3. Mental toughness
4. Experience

You need all four of these things to compete at a high level. I stress to new athletes that *experience* is often the missing piece of the puzzle. Skeleton requires years of hard work and dedication to master.
