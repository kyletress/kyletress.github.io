The National Team consists of the top 5 or 6 men and women in the United States. It used to be larger, but has been narrowed down in recent years. It may take several seasons to make the National Team, but that doesn't mean you won't be racing in events. The development team travels throughout North America and Europe as well, and occasionally bumps up to higher circuits throughout the season. The development circuits are a great place to learn the sport and the tracks so you will be ready to compete when you make the team.
