Injuries are a part of every sport, but skeleton injuries tend to be less gruesome than people think. We get some cuts and bruises, ice burn, and occasional lower leg injuries from sprinting. Serious injuries like fractures or breaks are rare, but they do occur. Concussions happen, and as a community we need to be more aware of CTE and the risk it poses. There is a noticeable decline in my cognitive abilities from October to March that's not coincidental. I'll be happy to put that side effect of skeleton behind me.

As I've grown older, I've become increasingly aware of the lasting damage skeleton has inflicted upon me. 15+ years of "car crashes without the car" has taken a toll on my body.
