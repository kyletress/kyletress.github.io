There's no one right answer. It will take testing and experience. Don't be afraid to try things that scare you a little bit. Write everything down. You'll build confidence in your equipment and eventually learn to make the right choice 90% of the time. I recommend every skeleton athlete read through [Ryan Davenport's website](http://www.davenportsleds.ca) for a thorough introduction to runners and how specific cuts affect control.
