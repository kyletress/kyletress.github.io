In more ways than I could mention. Everything fell into place when I started skeleton. It has pushed me in ways I never expected. It taught me to appreciate hard work and excellence, because those are the real rewards. It allowed me to travel the world. It introduced me to [my girlfriend](http://www.morgantracey.us). It gave me one of the greatest moments in my life at the Olympics and enough memories and friendships to last a lifetime.

In a more practical sense it gave me a greater appreciation and patience for flying.
