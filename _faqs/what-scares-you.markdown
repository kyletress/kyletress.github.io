title: What scares you?

The only thing that truly scares me are foreign objects in the track while I'm sliding. This includes items, animals, and people (all three have happened). We don't do a good enough job of protecting against this kind of mistake. As recently as January 2017, a track worker was in the track in Winterberg as a bobsled raced past. It missed him by inches.

- The track worker should have been fired. It's drastic, but we don't gamble with lives.  
- The track should have been heavily fined.
- An independent safety commission should have been called.

As far as I know, we did nothing. This is inexcusable.
