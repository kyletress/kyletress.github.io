I found skeleton by accident. In 2002 during the Salt Lake City Olympics, I clicked a link on the Yahoo! homepage that said 'Third Generation Olympian Wins Gold in Skeleton'. I had no idea what skeleton was, but something about that headline piqued my interest. After reading the article I registered for a summer training camp, followed by a skeleton school that winter in Lake Placid. After my very first trip down the track I decided to commit to making the Olympic Team. That process took me 12 years, which seems to be about average in the United States.
