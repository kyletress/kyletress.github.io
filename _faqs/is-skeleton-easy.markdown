No. Skeleton is *extremely* hard. It challenges you mentally and physically. It requires strength and power, skill and experience. It's a technical sport that requires feeling and awareness. The best skeleton athletes in the world make it look easy, as though they are just lying on the sled and letting it do the work. In reality they are making hundreds of decisions and subtle adjustments while hurtling headfirst down a mountain at 90mph.

 I don't hear this question too often these days. More people are familiar with skeleton and have a deeper appreciation for what it takes. This wasn't always true. There was an article in Sports Illustrated a few years ago by Rick Reilly. Rick took a few cheap shots, and in playful retaliation we invited him to Lake Placid to "walk the walk" and give skeleton a try. Not the easy tourist version, but the *real* thing, straight from the top.

 We never heard back. Rick, the offer stands. Bring lots of pads.
