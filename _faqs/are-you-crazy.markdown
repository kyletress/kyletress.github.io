This is usually the first question I'm asked by people who have no interest in competing. *No*, I am definitely not crazy. Skeleton does seem to attract some eccentric people, probably because it's incorrectly perceived as being an easy path to the Olympics. Those people don't last long. Those who remain are among the most interesting people I know.

I understand the question though. Skeleton looks crazy, and to be fair there are some [scary moments](). But it isn't as bad as it looks as long as everyone follows the rules and pays attention. I'm more concerned with things outside my control than those under my control.
