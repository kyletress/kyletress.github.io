I imagine it's different for every athlete, but for me it's *peaceful*. It's a minute of pure focus for my otherwise scattered brain. For 60 blissful seconds I have absolutely nothing else in the world to worry about.

It's also exhilarating and addicting, but if you're reading this you probably already knew that.
