This is probably the most common question I get, so I wrote a full post about it. In short, you should contact your National Governing Body, which in the US is *The United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation*. You'll probably sign up for a combine test, and if you do well you will be invited to Lake Placid for a skeleton school. If you enjoy the sport and the coaches like what they see, you'll enter our development pipeline and be on your way.
