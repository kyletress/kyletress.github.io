Congratulations! Making the decision is the easy part. Now you have to work insanely hard for the next several years while sacrificing everything, freezing your ass off, and racking up a bunch of debt. *Maybe* you'll make the Olympic team a few years down the road.

Qualifying for the Olympics is hard. There are no skeleton *wunderkinds* waiting to be discovered. It's extremely unlikely a person will start sliding and make the Olympic team four years later. It takes years of experience to develop the skill to compete at a high level on every track in the world.

Don't get discouraged. Show up, commit, and work hard. Good things will happen if you stick it out.
