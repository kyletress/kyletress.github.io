The winter is focused almost entirely on sliding and equipment prep, but we do make time for sprinting and lifting. We travel with a squat rack, weights, and a bench. We make use of local running tracks where we can find them. We lug 10lb bags of protein through airport security.

Sliding usually lasts a few hours. We often spend extra time watching athletes from other nations and walking the track, and we have a nightly meeting and video review session. Equipment preparation takes another hour or so. When you factor in time for sports medicine and recovery, the days are pretty full.
