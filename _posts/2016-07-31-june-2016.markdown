You’ll notice a new format this month. I’m experimenting with some new ideas. Please take a second to let me know what you think, and if you wouldn’t mind, forward this newsletter to a friend or two.

Last month I mentioned one of my favorite places for book recommendations (Gates Notes), and the response was amazing. Many of you have since asked about other sources, so this month I'd like to share a few of my favorites. Before I do, I want to talk about **one simple thing you can do to get more out of your reading**.

I recently posted [this picture of my nightstand on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BG5xfRkoHmN/?taken-by=kyletress). You might recognize a few of these books from previous newsletters; Hamilton, Sapiens, The Secret History, The Path to Power. I’ve recently finished these books, but I’m not finished *with* them.

When you finish a book, resist the urge to immediately put it back on your shelf. Keep it close, somewhere in sight, and let it settle for a few weeks. Your subconscious will do the rest.

When I return to a book (at least two weeks later, sometimes longer), I start by rapidly skimming through it. I re-read pages I’ve dog-eared. I transfer passages and marginalia to my [commonplace book](http://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/08/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/). I look through the bibliography for new books and add them to my reading list. Most importantly, I reinforce what I previously read. This helps me avoid a problem I’ve experienced too often: *putting a book down and instantly forgetting it*.

I read because I enjoy it, but also because reading makes us better. If there’s a loose theme to this newsletter, it’s *performance reading* - books to make us better leaders, better thinkers, better performers. Reading only to forget what we have read is like a rocking chair. [It gives you something to do, but it doesn’t get you anywhere](https://youtu.be/FrDSwK-e9VQ?t=32s).

Return to your books often. Read with pen in hand. Mark them up. Dog-ear favorite pages. Treat them as tools, not priceless works of art. You’ll remember more of what you read, and you’ll use it more often.

## June 2016 Recommended Reading

**[Ego is the Enemy](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1591847818/?tag=tress-20)** by Ryan Holiday

This was an instant purchase for me. Ryan’s recommended reading newsletter inspired me to start my own, and his own books are excellent. I read [The Obstacle is the Way](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1591846358/?tag=tress-20) a few months after the 2014 Olympics, and found much of it to be directly applicable to the pursuit of high performance. Ego is the Enemy is similarly structured, with numerous historical anecdotes and a *killer* bibliography. Highly recommended.
