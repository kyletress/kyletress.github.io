Fellow US Bobsled/Skeleton athletes,

Voting has started for our USOC AAC position, and I’d like to ask for your vote. I want to share with you my vision for the next 4 years if you elect me your representative. Before I do, I want to acknowledge Curt Tomasevicz for the work he put into representing us these past 8 years. Our federation is stronger thanks to him.

As your current USABS AAC chairman, I’ve worked with our coaches to reduce discretion throughout our criteria, making it fairer for all. I have pushed for greater transparency in our selection process. Most importantly, I have tried to make myself available to everyone; to offer solutions to problems, raise concerns to our staff, and to coach new athletes to our sports. I believe the USOC AAC position will require this kind of dedication.
There are several initiatives I’d like to bring before the USOC, but today I want to highlight two. First, I believe our athletes deserve a better, more comprehensive health insurance plan. I will work with the USOC AAC to draft improvements to EAHI; expanding its reach, lobbying for dental and vision coverage, and exploring tax benefits for those Olympians and World Championship Team members who receive it.

Second, I will work with the USOC AAC to create a subcommittee dedicated to exploring emerging technology. This subcommittee will make connections with tech leaders and foster relationships with companies who are building the future. I believe there are innovative technologies available today which can have an immediate and profound impact on Team USA’s performance across the entirety of the Olympic program.

As your AAC rep, my focus will always be on representing the interests of American bobsled and skeleton athletes first. But this position brings with it the ability and responsibility to improve the lives of American amateur athletes everywhere.

Thanks for your consideration,

Kyle Tress <br/>
USABS AAC Chair
