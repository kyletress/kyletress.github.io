Last April I started a monthly recommended reading newsletter. It’s been well received, and I enjoy writing each issue and sharing books with a small group of friends. If there’s a loose theme to the whole endeavor, it’s *performance reading* — reading for betterment rather than enjoyment. Performance reading starts with the idea that books can make us better thinkers and leaders, if we are willing to put in the work. Each issue I’ve tried to answer a question like *which books should we read, and which should we ignore*? *How can we read more, and perhaps most importantly, why should we*?

These are questions I think about often. I encourage people to read a lot more, but I realize that the demands of life get in the way. So each month, I try to distill 3 or 4 good books down to a few paragraphs, a task at which I fail more often than I succeed.

I’ve been thinking of ways to improve the newsletter since the beginning, from expanding on its theme to increasing its reach. I’ve rejected most changes because I don’t want to abuse the trust of my current readers. From the beginning, I’ve wanted the newsletter to read like an email from a friend rather than some over-designed template with buttons and tracking codes. That’s one of the reasons I’ve stayed with TinyLetter despite the temptation to upgrade to its big brother MailChimp [^1].

One change I’ve considered is updating my website to be better aligned with the newsletter. My site has been online since 2003, but I’ve rarely used it for anything besides skeleton. I blogged a bit back in 2010, and shared a few book reviews, but it’s always felt haphazard. What it lacked was a unifying theme, one that’s been staring me in the face since April.

Moving forward, **I am devoting my website to the study of performance, leadership, mastery, strategy, and reading**. My goal is to turn myself and my readers into better thinkers and leaders. To that effect, you’ll find:

- Original writing from my study of political leaders, elite athletes, historic figures, and other world-class performers.
- Book reviews.
- Access to my commonplace book.
- And of course, articles devoted to reading.

As a kickoff bonus, I’ve spent the past month updating the design of the site, adding some new articles, and adding in-depth book reviews for *every single book I’ve recommended in my newsletter so far*. It wasn’t easy (the content comes in at just over 60,000 words), but I’m glad I finally got around to it. I hope you'll check it out and let me know what you think.

As for new content, I’ll be adhering to a strict publishing schedule, with new stuff arriving every Monday and Thursday. The newsletter will remain monthly, and will continue to go out to a small group of friends. However I hope the group grows with the addition of new content and a larger distribution network. You can help me kickstart it by signing up for the newsletter, and sharing this article on Twitter, Facebook, or via email.
