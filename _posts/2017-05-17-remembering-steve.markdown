The sliding community lost a legend and my teammates and I lost a dear friend in Steve Holcomb. I knew Steve for 15 years -- not nearly long enough -- as we bonded over the *geeky* stuff we both loved: computers, video games, and terrible Kickstarter projects we backed despite knowing they'd never see the light of day.

I'm going to miss you so much, my friend. You will be forever, and deeply, missed.
