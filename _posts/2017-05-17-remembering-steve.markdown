The sliding community lost a legend and my teammates and I lost a dear friend in Steve Holcomb. I knew Steve for 15 years -- not nearly long enough -- and we bonded over geeky stuff we both loved: computers, video games, and terrible Kickstarter projects we backed despite knowing they'd never see the light of day.

You will be forever missed, my friend.
