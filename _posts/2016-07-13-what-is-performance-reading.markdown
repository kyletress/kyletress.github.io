**Performance reading** is reading for *betterment* rather than enjoyment. It's both a concept and a system; a way of thinking about reading paired with a concrete plan for reading more books, better books, and getting more out of those books. Let's dive in.

## The Concept

Let's start by looking at performance reading from a conceptual point of view. There are many different kinds of reading, few ways to approach reading, all of them valid. There's reading for enjoyment. Picking up your favorite novel for the beach or the plane, and diving into a rich and exquisite world created by the author. There's required reading, the kind we face in school or university, or perhaps at work. This kind of reading tends to be the dull even though it doesn't have to be.

Performance reading is a new way of thinking about reading. It's neither required nor for enjoyment. Performance reading is about

When we read  



By reading better books, we can turn ourselves into better thinkers and leaders. Not all books are created equal, and in a world which seems to reward quick, vapid, and thoughtless expression over deep thinking and difficult reading,


In his excellent essay [Solitutde and Leadership](), former Yale professor William D spoke at length about the importance of reading books, *old books*, in the pursuit of better leadership and thinking. Old books, he argues, were revolutionary in their time, and remain so today precisely because they are old. They no longer reflect the current mainstream thinking. He goes on to discuss the importance of single-tasking, something which is difficult to do in the world of tweets, status updates, and posts.  

Since April 2015, I've been sending a recommended reading newsletter out to a small group of friends. In the newsletter, I try to recommend books that meet this criteria. They aren't always old books, but they are books I deem important to read. I've been seraching for a loose theme to group all the newsletter together, and the one I came up with was *performance reading*. Performance reading is the idea that by reading better books, we can become better thinkers and leaders. That's it. Of course there is more to it than that. We have to learn [how to correctly read a book](). We have to [focus on what we are doing](), not the million other little things vying for attention. We have to [dedicate time for reading every day](). These things are challenging because life doesn't always agree.

But William's essay has stuck with me. Our future leaders, the best and brightest minds, aren't learning to *lead*. Their lives, micromanaged and scheduled and organized for years, are teaching them to suceed inside a beauracracy instead of becoming the bright, freethinking, and creative leaders we need. That's where performance reading comes in. People have always had the tools to drastically increase their intelligence and understandin of the world; to improve intelligence, empathy, and knowledge. Books. But we have to do the work. It won't be done for us.

## What (and what not) to read
Performance reading isn't just about finding excellent books. It's about learning what not to read. Maybe more specifically, what to limit. Our willpower is a limited resource, and once it's used up we can't easily get it back. Every tweet, every status update, takes a toll on us. The same is true of "old" media. Newspapers, television, radio. it's not to say these things are bad. They aren't. I love reading the NYTimes every day, and the Economist every week. I like This American Life and other radio shows (and now podcasts). But it's about learning to limit our consumption of these types of media so we can better spend our time learnign to think for ourselves. The only way to do so it by reading; challenging books, books "above our level", and certainly books that have stood the test of time.

## Performance reading
Performance reading isn't reading for enjoyment. It's reading for *betterment*.

1. Identitfy what to read (Need help? [I can recommend some books](/newsletter))
2. Limit noise and boost signal.
3. Destroy your books.
4. Return to your books.
5. Think about your reading.
6. Buy a book from the bibliography.

Read more. A lot more. Read like it's your job (it probably is, even if you don't know it yet). Destroy your books. Mark them up with pen, pencil, dogears, post-its, highlighters, whatever -- just do it in a way that is useful to you. I've always resisted marking up my books because I felt some special attachment to them as objects. Fuck that. A book's value derives from the words inside [^1]

[^1]: Here I'm talking about *most* books. If you collect rare books, please don't destroy them. But you already know that!
