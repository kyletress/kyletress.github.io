Last April I started a monthly recommended reading newsletter. It's been well received, and I enjoy writing each issue and sharing books with an intimate group of friends. If there's a loose theme to the whole endeavor, it's *performance reading*, i.e. how reading makes us better thinkers and leaders. Each issue I've tried to answer in part a few questions: which books should we read, and which should we ignore? How can people read more? Perhaps most importantly, *why should we read more*?

These are questions I think about every day. I encourage people to read more (a lot more), but I realize that the demands of life get in the way. So each month, I try to distill the essence of 3 or 4 good books down to a few paragraphs, a task at which I fail more often than I succeed.

I've been thinking of ways to improve the newsletter since the beginning, from expanding on its theme to increasing its reach. I've rejected most changes because I don't want to abuse the trust of my current readers. From the beginning, I've wanted the newsletter to read like an email from a friend rather than some over-designed template with buttons and tracking codes. That's one of the reasons I've stuck with [TinyLetter](https://www.tinyletter.com) despite the temptation to upgrade to its big brother MailChimp[^1].

One change I haven't outright rejected is pivoting my website to be better aligned with the theme of the newsletter. My website has been online in [one form or another](https://web.archive.org/web/20040125044132/http://www.skeletonslider.com/) since 2003, but I've rarely used it for anything outside of skeleton. I blogged a bit back in 2010, and recently I've shared a few book reviews, but it's always felt haphazard. What it lacked was a unifying theme, one that's been staring me in the face since April [^2].

Moving forward, kyletress.com is dedicated to something I'm calling **performance reading**: the idea that books can make us better thinkers, leaders, and achievers. Here you'll find:

* Original writing on performance, leadership, mastery, and strategy, derived from my study of political leaders, world-class athletes, historic figures, and various high-performers.

* short and long-form book reviews.

* Access to my commonplace book.

* And of course, articles devoted to reading.

I'll be sticking to a strict publishing schedule with new content appearing every Monday and Thursday. The newsletter will remain monthly, and will continue to go out to a small group of friends. However I hope the group grows with the addition of new content and a larger distribution network. You can help me kickstart it by signing up for the newsletter, and sharing this article on Twitter, Facebook, or via email.

[^1]: Nothing against MailChimp. I still might switch over.
[^2]: Funny how that works. It's always the things right in front of us that we miss. It reminds me of a show I watched a few years ago on the training of BUD/S class 225.
