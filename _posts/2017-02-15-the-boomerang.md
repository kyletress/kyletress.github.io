When was the last time you checked Facebook? Twitter? Instagram? Probably recently. Maybe just before you arrived here. Maybe you are checking it right now, multitasking between this essay, the tv in the background, and the 15 other tabs open in your browser.

The boomerang is returning. It *feels* different this time. it feels like people are starting to believe that social media might actually be bad for us; for our culture, our politics, our attention span, our friendships, our empathy, our mental - our *physical* - health, our sanity, our creativity, our relationships, our *everything*. The arguments are simple and better laid out elsewhere, but they reduce to the following:

- The companies who back these monstrosities are untrustworthy.
- We are the product; our data is for sale.
- We are being spied on.
- These services are designed for addiction.

But social media is fashionable, much like smoking was in the 60s. Will future generations regard social media as poorly as we do smoking today? Will it take that long?

If you have ever considered disappearing from the internet, or just taking a break, now is the time. It's easy to do. I've linked some resources at the bottom of the post. Start by deactivating Facebook and see how it goes. it's low commitment, and you can always come back later. If you feel better after a few weeks, delete it completely (you can even take an archive of your data with you).
