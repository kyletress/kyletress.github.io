Once a month I send a short email featuring 3 or 4 books I have read and personally recommend. The genres vary, but I mostly read biography, history, politics, philosophy, performance, and psychology.

The theme of the newsletter is **performance reading**: reading for improvement over enjoyment; to become better thinkers and leaders. Love great books? You should sign up below or visit [http://www.tinyletter.com/kyletress]( http://www.tinyletter.com/kyletress).
