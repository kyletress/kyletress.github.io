# Skeleton

Skeleton is an intentionally simple base Jekyll theme. Its minimal design is suitable for customization while remaining content-focused.  

## Installation

Clone the repository:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/kyletress/skeleton.git
~~~

The theme includes `ruby-version` and `.ruby-gemset` files for RVM. `ruby 2.1.7` is recommended.

Run bundle:

~~~
bundle install
~~~

This installs the `github-pages` gem, which will mimic the GitHub Pages environment.

Start the Jekyll server:

~~~
jekyll serve --watch
~~~

## Customization

Coming soon.
