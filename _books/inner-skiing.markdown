### 1. Skiing is more than a parallel turn

> There is a magic in skiing when all is going well that transcends anything I have experienced in other sports. As I soar down a mountainside letting my body find its won balance in turn after turn, my mind as clear as the cold air against my face, my heart feels as warm as the sun, and I attain a level of experience which compels me to return to the snow for more and more of the same. 

> The Inner Skier comes to recognize that his greatest challenge, and consequently his greatest possibilities, lies in overcoming the self-imposed mental limitations that prevent the full expression of his physical potential. 

> The hell with it. I'm going to stop fighting the hill and just ski. If I fall, I fall. I can't do any worse than I'm doing now. 

> Fear, which is probably the biggest obstacle to any learning process, is a repressive force. It exists in the mind, and almost always it is based on something that *might* happen in the future, rather than what *is* happening now.

> Skiing, too, can be effortless when we cooperate with gravity's forces instead of fighting them. 

> In most sports we rely on our own power to run or jump, throw a ball, or swing a racket. But in skiing, gravity provides the power and pulls us down the slope. The only exertion necessary is to play with the pull -- checking, turning, slowing, and directing our movement.
