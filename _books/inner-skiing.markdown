### 1. Skiing is more than a parallel turn

> There is a magic in skiing when all is going well that transcends anything I have experienced in other sports. As I soar down a mountainside letting my body find its won balance in turn after turn, my mind as clear as the cold air against my face, my heart feels as warm as the sun, and I attain a level of experience which compels me to return to the snow for more and more of the same. 

> The Inner Skier comes to recognize that his greatest challenge, and consequently his greatest possibilities, lies in overcoming the self-imposed mental limitations that prevent the full expression of his physical potential. 

> The hell with it. I'm going to stop fighting the hill and just ski. If I fall, I fall. I can't do any worse than I'm doing now. 

> Fear, which is probably the biggest obstacle to any learning process, is a repressive force. It exists in the mind, and almost always it is based on something that *might* happen in the future, rather than what *is* happening now.

> Skiing, too, can be effortless when we cooperate with gravity's forces instead of fighting them. 

> In most sports we rely on our own power to run or jump, throw a ball, or swing a racket. But in skiing, gravity provides the power and pulls us down the slope. The only exertion necessary is to play with the pull -- checking, turning, slowing, and directing our movement.  

> Blending, a basic principle in the martial arts, can also be used in skiing, teaching us when to flow with the force of gravity and when to resist it. 

> Skiing is a sport of changes; no two runs are ever the same. 

> When you have preconceived notions about a slope, you won't truly experience it. You see the slope as you think it is, or as it was before, rather than as it is now. When you hit something, it comes as a surprise. This is the mountain's way of saying *pay attention*. 

> I have begun to pay more attention to the quality of what I am doing rather than to the quantity. 

> Hence, skiing can teach us something that is often overlooked in our goal-oriented daily activities: *the importance of enjoying the process*. From it we can learn the without appreciating th path, reaching the goal is often meaningless. Moreover, we discover that games of all kinds are more often won when first they are enjoyed.
