**I'm Kyle Tress**. I'm an Olympic athlete in the sport of skeleton. When I'm not racing headfirst down a mountain of ice at 90 miles per hour, I'm a Ruby on Rails developer at [Instaviser]() and a web tester at [The Wirecutter](https://www.wirecutter.com).

I'm studying data science and machine learning in preparation for life after sport. Once a week I recommend a few of my great books in my [reading list email](/newsletter).
