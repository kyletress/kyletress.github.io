## Contact Information
For the moment, I'm *intentionally* hard to reach. Between training for the 2018 Winter Olympics, working at a startup, writing a book, and other responsibilities, my time and attention are spoken for at least through February 2018. I don't have a general email address and I don't use social media (Twitter is a rare exception).

The best way to reach me is in person. I do occasionally receive interesting opportunities via email, so if you have an interview request, opportunity, or introduction, please reach out to me and I'll respond to those which best suit my interests and schedule. With that in mind, I have a few requests:

1. If you'd like to interview me about skeleton, please contact [USA Bobsled/Skeleton]().
2. If you want skeleton advice, please first see my [frequently asked questions](/faqs), which cover 95% of the questions I receive.
3. Please do **not** contact me with equity-only offers. My hourly rate for Ruby on Rails development is $90.
