## Contact Information

I'm intentionally hard to reach. I do this to make the most of the time I have outside of my commitments: training for the Olympics, working at a startup, writing a book, reading 100+ books each year, and athlete rep duties. I don't have a general purpose email address and I don't use social media. The most reliable way to reach me is in person.

### Interesting

I occasionally receive interesting opportunities via email. If that's you, please contact me at [interesting@kyletress.com](mailto:interesting@kyletress.com). I appreciate these emails, but I'm usually unable to respond except to those which best suit my interests and schedule.

### Interview requests

To schedule skeleton-related interviews, please contact Kristen Gowdy at [USA Bobsled/Skeleton]().

### Skeleton advice and coaching

I no longer have plans to coach after retirement. Instead please see my [frequently asked questions](/faqs) and send me an email at [skeleton@kyletress.com](mailto:skeleton@kyletress.com) if your question isn't answered.

### Employment opportunities

I will gladly consider most employment offers. I'm a senior-level Rails developer, and I prefer working on monolithic apps which adhere to the [Rails Doctrine](). Opportunities would have to be remote until March 2018. Please reach me at [hello@kyletress.com](mailto:hello@kyletress.com). I *might* consider part-time and contract jobs, though I bill a daily rate of $700/day. Please do not contact me with equity offers.
