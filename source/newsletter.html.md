title: A monthly email from Kyle Tress
---

In lieu of social media, I write a monthly [tinyletter](https://www.tinyletter.com) for friends and fans. I despise the current *build an audience/personal branding* groupthink. I just want to share a few updates with a small group. You're welcome to subscribe (or unsubscribe) at any time.

I usually write about:

- Books and reading recommendations
- Training and performance
- Skeleton (and racing in general)
- Occasional tech-stuff (rarely)
- Life events and updates.
