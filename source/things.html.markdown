## The things I love (and recommend)

*A brief note on things:*
I try to be mindful about the stuff I buy and the cost of ownership. I'm not a minimalist, but I do like some of its principles. For instance, I aim to own *less but better* things, preferably "buy-it-for-life" items. I think my personal philosophy more closely aligns with [essentialism]().    

### Physical Stuff

**Aeropress Coffee Maker**<br>
The Aeropress is the best way to make a single cup of coffee. It's inexpensive, portable, allows for a ton of experimentation. I traveled Europe with this (along with a European electric kettle) and it worked like a champ.

**[GORUCK bags]()**<br>
Indestructible. Made in the USA. They look great too. These bags will last a lifetime. Backed by members of the United States Special Forces.

**Outlier Merino Wool Tees**

**Allbirds Shoes**<br>
My obsession with merino wool extends to footwear. Allbirds are the best shoes I've ever owned. They look great and they are comfortable, too. The only downside is they are not good in the snow (too slippery) though with the redesigned sole this might have been addressed. I like the wool runners but I'm looking forward to buying a pair of loungers.

**Baron Fig Notebooks**<br>
Baron Fig makes my favorite notebook in 3 sizes and 2 colors. I like the charcoal option in the flagship size. They are the right dimensions, great paper, nice dot grid, and the open flat.

### News
My favorite places to get news are:  

- The New York Times
- The Economist (digital subscription)
- Face the Nation (Sunday mornings on CBS)

As part of my interest in [deep work]() I am trying to limit my exposure to news. Outside these main sources, I occasionally find interesting things on Twitter and Reddit.
