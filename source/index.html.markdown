# Hi, I'm **Kyle Tress**

I'm an Olympic athlete in the sport of skeleton and a Ruby on Rails developer. I work at [Instaviser](), and I'm studying data science and machine learning in preparation for life after sport. Once a month I recommend a few of my favorite books in my [reading list email](/newsletter).
