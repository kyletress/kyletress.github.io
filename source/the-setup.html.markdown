title: The Setup
---

I'm Kyle Tress, an Olympic skeleton athlete and Rails developer. I race headfirst down a mountain of ice at 90 miles per hour.

## What hardware are you using?

I'm an Apple fan. My work machine is a base model 12" MacBook which I use for web and mobile development. Otherwise the iPad Air 2 is my primary device. I generally prefer iOS to OS X.

My iPhone is an extension of my brain and I never leave home without it. I use it to capture ideas, browse the web, listen to podcasts, and shoot 1 second videos. It's my primary camera. I am [protective of my attention]() so I turn off notifications and permanently enable Do Not Disturb mode.

I have an Apple Watch which I love. I delegate critical notifcations to the watch, and I use it as a sleep tracker and silent alarm. It's a great training and travel partner. Using Apple Pay is frictionless and I'm excited for the day when it completely replaces my wallet.

Reading is my favorite hobby. I have a [Kindle Voyage](http://www.amazon.com/kindle), but it doesn't get much use anymore as I prefer physical books. I don't have cable but I love Netflix and HBO Go on my AppleTV.     

I'm on the road 6 months per year. I love airplanes almost as much as I love Apple, but I couldn't survive a long flight without a pair of noise canceling headphones. At the moment, I use both Beats Solo 2s and AirPods, but neither are ideal for an airplane cabin. I'm considering Bose QuietComforts.

While traveling, essentials get packed in my Scottevest Revolution jacket, and the rest goes in my Tom Bihn aeronaut and GORUCK Bullet. I throw in an AeroPress, Hario Grinder, and an electric travel kettle and I'm all set to make great coffee wherever my sled takes me.

## And what software?
I write long form content in Scrivener, everything else in Ulysses. Atom is (currently) my code editor of choice, but I'm exploring Vim.

I prefer Safari for daily browsing. I couldn't imagine life without 1password, and integration with iOS extensions has made it much more convenient.  

I use too many iOS apps to mention, but a few favorites include Netflix, NYTimes, Reddit, NFL GamePass, Coda, Transmit, Day One, Sky Guide, and GoodReader.

I try to live in the cloud as much as possible. My code is on GitHub, and I rely heavily on iCloud. The fewer items on my local computer, the better.   

## What would be your dream setup?
I'm happy with my current setup, though I wouldn't mind a bigger library and an Eames lounge chair.
