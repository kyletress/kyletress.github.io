## Site Credits

My website is a static site built in Ruby and powered by [Middleman](https://www.middlemanapp.com). It's hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and the source code is on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/kyletress/kyletress.com). I registered the domain name in 2007 and I've been working on it ever since.

### Philosophy
I like simplicity. Too many personal sites are victims of excess; they are littered with sharing buttons, annoying popups, gratuitous graphics, heavy webfonts, insecure plugins, bloated javascripts, and items that serve no other purpose than to slow things down for the reader and complicate things for their owner. I respect visitors by removing non-essential elements, and **I don't use analytics or tracking tools**. I keep the site and its content lean.

### Technology stack

- [Middleman](https://www.middlemanapp.com)

- System fonts!
- Terminal.app, [Atom.ide]().
- Sass, Haml, and Markdown.

### How I work
I often work from my iPad, using [Working Copy](), [Textastic](), and [Blink Shell](). For a detailed look at the tools I use, check out [the setup](/the-setup).
