## Site Credits

This site was designed and built by Kyle Tress. I'm a Ruby on Rails developer by trade and I've been working on the web since 1995.


### Philosophy
I believe in simplicity and [essentialism](). Many personal sites are victims of excess; they are littered with sharing tools, annoying popups, unnecessary graphics, unused webfonts, insecure plugins, bloated javascripts, and a bunch of things that serve no purpose other than to slow things down for the reader and complicate things for their owner. I strive to respect my readers and visitors by removing all non-essential elements. I review the site every few months to see if there is more to take away. Because of this, the site is often changing appearance.

### What I use

- [Middleman]()
- [Netlify]() (for continuous integration and building the site)
- [Contently]() for CMS
- [Fuze.js]() for search on the commonplace book pages
- GitHub ([source code]()) and GitHub Pages for hosting
- System fonts
- Terminal.app, [Atom.ide]().
- Sass, Haml, and markdown.

### How I work
I often work from my iPad. I use [working copy](), [Drafts](), and [Slack]() for most of my work. For a more detailed look at the tools I use, check out [the setup](/the-setup).
