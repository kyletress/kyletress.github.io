**We all float down here**. I'm excited to see IT this September. I remember watching the tv miniseries as a kid and being scared to death. Outside of Tim Curry's performance as Pennywise, it has't really held up. From what I've seen so far, it looks like this will be the definitive version. (at least for the next, oh, 27 years...)
