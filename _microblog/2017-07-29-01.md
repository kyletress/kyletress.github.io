**[Why the White House is reading Thucydides](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/21/why-the-white-house-is-reading-greek-history-215287)**

Interesting article. I've been reading *The History of the Peloponnesian War* and *The Landmark Thucydides* over the past few months. It seems the idea of a *Thucydides Trap* is picking up steam.
