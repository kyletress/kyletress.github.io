I've had a great skeleton career: 16 years, multiple national and international medals (though unfortunately never a World Cup medal), and 2 Olympic Games. Outside of my local market, I never got much attention -- certainly not from the USOC or USA Bobsled/Skeleton. That's probably the thing that pisses me off the most. The thing I'm most proud of is this interview with the New York Times. People were mad at me over this, but they didn't understand the strategy behind it.
