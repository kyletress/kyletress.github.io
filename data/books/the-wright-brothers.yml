review: >
  <p>I think David McCullough is one of the finest popular history writers of our time. With <em>The Wright Brothers</em> he has delivered a rich account of the birth of powered flight. But this isn't a book about airplanes -- it's a biography of the two bicycle mechanics who willed them into existence through sheer intellect and unwavering commitment.</p>
