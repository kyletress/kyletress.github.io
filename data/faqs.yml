  faqs:
    - q: Skeleton? Are you crazy?
      a: Most common question brah.
    - q: How did you get started?
      a: I found skeleton by accident. In 2002 during the Salt Lake City Olympics, I clicked a link on the Yahoo! homepage that said 'Third Generation Olympian Wins Gold in Skeleton'. I had no idea what skeleton was, but something about that headline piqued my interest. After reading the article I registered for a summer training camp, followed by a skeleton school that winter in Lake Placid. After my very first trip down the track I decided to commit to making the Olympic Team. That process took me 12 years, which seems to be about average in the United States.
    - q: How do I get started?
      a: This is probably the most common question I get, so I wrote a full post about it. In short, you should contact your National Governing Body, which in the US is The United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation. You'll probably sign up for a combine test, and if you do well you will be invited to Lake Placid for a skeleton school. If you enjoy the sport and the coaches like what they see, you'll enter our development pipeline and be on your way.
    - q: I want to be an Olympian. What do I need to do?
      a: Congratulations! Making the decision is the easy part. Now you have to work insanely hard for the next several years while sacrificing everything, freezing your ass off, and racking up a bunch of debt. Maybe you’ll make the Olympic team a few years down the road. Qualifying for the Olympics is hard. There are no skeleton wunderkinds waiting to be discovered. It’s extremely unlikely you will make the Olympic team four years after starting. It takes years of experience to develop the skill to compete at a high level on every track in the world. Don’t get discouraged. Show up, commit, and work hard. Good things will happen if you stick it out.
    - q: Will I get hurt?
      a: |
        Injuries are a part of every sport, but skeleton injuries tend to be less gruesome than people think. We get some cuts and bruises, ice burn, and occasional lower leg injuries from sprinting. Serious injuries like fractures or breaks are rare, but they do occur. Concussions happen, and as a community we need to be more aware of CTE and the risk it poses. There is a noticeable decline in my cognitive abilities from October to March that’s not coincidental. I’ll be happy to put that side effect of skeleton behind me.

        As I’ve grown older, I’ve become increasingly aware of the lasting damage skeleton has inflicted upon me. 15+ years of “car crashes without the car” has taken a toll on my body.

      a: Yes
    - q: Did you do well?
      a: No.

- category: Sliding
  faqs:
    - q: Have you ever crashed?
      a: I've never crashed to the point of losing my sled, but I've taken some big, painful hits. The worst have been in Konigssee and Lake Placid.

- category: Training
  faqs:
    - q: How do you train in the winter?
      a: The winter is focused almost entirely on sliding and equipment prep, but we do make time for sprinting and lifting. We travel with a squat rack, weights, and a bench. We make use of local running tracks where we can find them. We lug 10lb bags of protein through airport security. Sliding usually lasts a few hours. We often spend extra time watching athletes from other nations and walking the track, and we have a nightly meeting and video review session. Equipment preparation takes another hour or so. When you factor in time for sports medicine and recovery, the days are pretty full.

  faqs:
    - q: Which runners should I use?
      a: There's no one right answer. It will take testing and experience. Don't be afraid to try things that scare you a little bit. Write everything down. You'll build confidence in your equipment and eventually learn to make the right choice 90% of the time. I recommend every skeleton athlete read through <a href="http://www.davenportsleds.ca">Ryan Davenport's website</a> for a thorough introduction to runners and how specific cuts affect control.

  faqs:
    - q: Have you competed on every track?
      a: No. Of those tracks still in use, I haven't slid on Sigulda, Lillehammer, Paramanovo, Oberhof, or Nagano.
