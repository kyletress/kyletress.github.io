Last April I started a monthly recommended reading newsletter. It's been well received, and I enjoy writing each issue and sharing books with an intimate group of friends. If there's a loose theme to the whole endeavor, it's *performance reading*, i.e. how reading makes us better thinkers, leaders, and human beings. Each issue I've tried to partly answer a few key questions: which books should we read, and which should we ignore? How can I read more? Perhaps most importantly, *why should I read more*?

These are questions I think about every day. I encourage people to read more (a lot more), but I realize that the demands of life get in the way. So each month, I try to distill the essence of 3 or 4 good books down to a few paragraphs, a task at which I fail more often than I succeed.

I've been thinking of ways to improve the newsletter since the beginning, from expanding on its theme to increasing its reach. I've rejected most changes because I don't want to abuse the trust of the readers I have. From the beginning, I've wanted the newsletter to be more like a simple email from a friend than some over-designed template with buttons and tracking codes. That's one of the reasons I've stuck with [TinyLetter](https://www.tinyletter.com) despite temptation to upgrade to its big brother MailChimp (Mail...kimp?). And who wants to unsubscribe from emails from their friends?

One change I haven't outright rejected is pivoting my website to be better aligned with the theme of the newsletter. My website has been online in [one form or another](https://web.archive.org/web/20040125044132/http://www.skeletonslider.com/) since 2003, but I've rarely used it for anything outside of skeleton. I blogged a bit back in 2010, and recently I've shared some book reviews, but it all felt haphazard. What it lacked was a theme to tie the whole together, despite one that's been staring me in the face since April.

Moving forward, kyletress.com is dedicated to something I'm calling **performance reading**: the idea that books can make us better thinkers, leaders, and achievers. Here you'll find:

* Original writing on performance, leadership, mastery, and strategy, derived from my study of political leaders, world-class athletes, historic figures, and various high-performers. 

* short and long-form book reviews.

* Access to my personal commonplace book (for members).

* And of course, articles devoted to reading.

I'll be sticking to a strict publishing schedule with new content appearing every Monday and Thursday. For now, the newsletter will stay on its monthly schedule. It will still go out to a small group of friends. However I hope the group grows with the addition of new content and a larger distribution network. You can help me kickstart it by signing up for the newsletter, and sharing this article on Twitter, Facebook, or via email.
